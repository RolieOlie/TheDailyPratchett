      <description><![CDATA["Currently there's five machines permanently networked here. They *all*
contain the serious core stuff. A couple of the machines are pensioned off
486s, with little other value now. Plus there's two Jaz drives in the

      <description><![CDATA["In fact, no gods anywhere play chess. They prefer simple, vicious games,
where you Do Not Achieve Transcendence but Go Straight to Oblivion; a key
to the understanding of all religion is that a god's idea of amusement is
