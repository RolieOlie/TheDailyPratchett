heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness for that," he said. "Neither did I.""<br><br>Rincewind and Twoflower take up broomstick flying - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["A heap of discarded garments by the bed suggested that Verence had mastered
the art of hanging up clothes as practised by half the population of the

known as 'up', 'down', 'sideways', 'sex appeal' and 'peppermint'."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>
