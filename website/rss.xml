      <description><![CDATA["- "Surely you have considered terrorist activity?"
There was another pause. Then the spokesman said, in the quiet tones of
someone who has had enough and who is going to quit after this and raise
chickens somewhere, "Yes, I suppose we must. All we need to do is find some
terrorists who are capable of taking an entire nuclear reactor out of its
can while it's running and without anyone noticing. It weighs about a
thousand tons and is forty feet high. So they'll be quite *strong*
terrorists. Perhaps you'd like to ring them up, sir, and ask them questions
in that supercilious, accusatory way of yours.""<br><br>The BBC interviews a nuclear spokesperson - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

my son, which of these is the most stylish thing to wear? And the correct
answer is: Hey, whatever I select."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The old shaman said carefully, "You didn't just see two men go through
upside down on a broomstick, shouting and screaming at each other, did
you?" The boy looked at him levelly. "Certainly not," he said. The old man
heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness for that," he said. "Neither did I.""<br><br>Rincewind and Twoflower take up broomstick flying - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>
