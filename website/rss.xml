      <description><![CDATA["There should be a notice ahead of the movie that says 'This
movie is PG.  Can you read?  You are a Parent.  Do you understand what
Guidance is?  Or are you just another stupid toddler who thinks they're
an adult simple because they've grown older and, unfortunately, have
developed fully-functioning sexual organs?  Would you like some
committee somewhere to decide *everything* for you?  Get a damn grip,
will you?  And shut the wretched kid up !'"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The only things known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy,
according to the philosopher Ly Tin Weedle. He reasoned like this: you
can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap
between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to
the heir *instantaneously*. Presumably, he said, there must be some
elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job,
but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an
anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to
send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to
modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the
bar closed."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Mort]]></description>
