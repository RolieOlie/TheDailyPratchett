      <description><![CDATA["He was aware that a wise man should always respect the folkways of others,
to use Carrot's happy phrase, but Vimes often had difficulty with this
idea. For one thing, there were people in the world whose folkways
consisted of gutting other people like clams and this was not a procedure
that commanded, in Vimes, any kind of respect at all."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Hodgesaargh was an original storyteller and quite good in a very specific
way. If he'd had to recount the saga of the Tsortean War, for example, it
would have been in terms of the birds observed, every cormorant noted,
every pelican listed, every battlefield raven taxonomically placed, no tern
unturned. Some men in armour would have been involved at some stage, but
only because the ravens were perching on them."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Carpe Jugulum]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The Monks of Cool, whose tiny and exclusive monastery is hidden in a really
cool and laid-back valley in the lower Ramtops, have a passing-out test for a
novice. He is taken into a room full of all types of clothing and asked: Yo,
my son, which of these is the most stylish thing to wear? And the correct
answer is: Hey, whatever I select."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>
