them into dust and ten years later someone drops a drop of blood in the
wrong place and *guess who's back*? They returned more times than raw
broccoli."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Feet of Clay]]></description>

not, much as I always admired your straightforward approach, and indeed
your forthright stance, actually *give* you my house, it being the only
house I have, and therefore the term is being extended in an, as it were,
gratuitous fashion --"
Owlglass was clearly having some trouble getting to the end of the sentence."<br><br>Carpet philosophers at work - Terry Pratchett, The Carpet People]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Currently there's five machines permanently networked here. They *all*
contain the serious core stuff. A couple of the machines are pensioned off
486s, with little other value now. Plus there's two Jaz drives in the
building and the portable also carries a fair amount of stuff. Plus every
Friday a man comes around and carves all the new stuff onto stone slabs and
buries them in the garden... I think I'm okay."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["In fact, no gods anywhere play chess. They prefer simple, vicious games,
where you Do Not Achieve Transcendence but Go Straight to Oblivion; a key
to the understanding of all religion is that a god's idea of amusement is
