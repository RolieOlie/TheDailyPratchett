      <description><![CDATA["It wasn't a dark and stormy night.
It should have been, but there's the weather for you. For every mad
scientist who's had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his Great
Work is complete and lying on the slab, there have been dozens who've sat
around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the
overtime."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[""Well, basically there are two sorts of opera,' said Nanny, who also had
the true witch's ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no
experience whatsoever. 'There's your heavy opera, where basically people
sing foreign and it goes like "Oh oh oh, I am dyin', oh, I am dyin', oh,
oh, oh, that's what I'm doin'", and there's your light opera, where they
sing in foreign and it basically goes "Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer! I like to
drink lots of beer!", although sometimes they drink champagne instead.
That's basically all of opera, reely.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Maskerade]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[""This isn't how I imagined it, chaps," said War. "I haven't been waiting
for thousands of years just to fiddle around with bits of wire.  It's not
what you'd call *dramatic*. Albrecht Duerer didn't waste his time doing
woodcuts of the Four Button-Pressers of the Apocalypse, I do know that.""<br><br>Armageddon delayed by technical difficulties - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>
