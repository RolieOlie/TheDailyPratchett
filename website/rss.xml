      <description><![CDATA["Wobbler had written an actual computer game like this once. It was called
"Journey to Alpha Centauri". It was a screen with some dots on it.
Because, he said, it happened in *real time*, which no-one had ever heard
of until computers. He'd seen on TV that it took three thousand years to
get to Alpha Centauri. He had written it so that if anyone kept their
computer on for three thousand years, they'd be rewarded by a little dot
appearing in the middle of the screen, and then a message saying, "Welcome
to Alpha Centauri. Now go home.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Only You Can Save Mankind]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["My experience in Amsterdam is that cyclists ride  where the hell they
like and aim in a state of rage at all pedestrians while ringing their
bell loudly, the concept of avoiding people being foreign to them.

My dream holiday would be a) a ticket to Amsterdam b) immunity from
prosecution and c) a baseball bat  :-)"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>
