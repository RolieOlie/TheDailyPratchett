      <description><![CDATA["Currently there's five machines permanently networked here. They *all*
contain the serious core stuff. A couple of the machines are pensioned off
486s, with little other value now. Plus there's two Jaz drives in the
building and the portable also carries a fair amount of stuff. Plus every
Friday a man comes around and carves all the new stuff onto stone slabs and
buries them in the garden... I think I'm okay."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["In the second scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised a story is written
concerning one day when the apprentice Clodpool, in a rebellious mood,
approached Wen and spake thusly:
"Master, what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic
system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently
nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic
gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?"
Wen considered this for some time, and at last said: "A fish!"
And Clodpool went away, satisfied."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[""My house is your house", his brow suddenly furrowed and he looked worried,
"although only in a metaphorical sense, you understand, because I would
not, much as I always admired your straightforward approach, and indeed
your forthright stance, actually *give* you my house, it being the only
house I have, and therefore the term is being extended in an, as it were,
gratuitous fashion --"
Owlglass was clearly having some trouble getting to the end of the sentence."<br><br>Carpet philosophers at work - Terry Pratchett, The Carpet People]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Most people in Lancre, as the saying goes, went to bed with the chickens
and got up with the cows. [footnote: Er. That is to say, they went to bed
at the same time as the chickens went to bed, and got up at the same time
as the cows got up. Loosely worded sayings can really cause
misunderstandings.]"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Maskerade]]></description>
