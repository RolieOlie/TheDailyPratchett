      <description><![CDATA["The one positive thing you could say about the bread products around him
was that they were probably as edible now as they were on the day they were
baked. *Forged* was a better term. Dwarf bread was made as a meal of last
resort and also as a weapon and a currency. Dwarfs were not, as far as
Vimes knew, religious in any way, but the way they thought about bread came
close."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>
