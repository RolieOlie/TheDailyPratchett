else had realised it either, because the sound is made over hundreds of
years in waves of twenty-four hours from peak to peak. Speed it up, and

TURTLES and SPACE SHUTTLES. An interesting place which is warm and wet and

approached Wen and spake thusly:
"Master, what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic
system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently
nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic
gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?"
Wen considered this for some time, and at last said: "A fish!"
And Clodpool went away, satisfied."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time]]></description>
