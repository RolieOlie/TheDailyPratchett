      <description><![CDATA[""Well, basically there are two sorts of opera,' said Nanny, who also had
the true witch's ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no
experience whatsoever. 'There's your heavy opera, where basically people
sing foreign and it goes like "Oh oh oh, I am dyin', oh, I am dyin', oh,
oh, oh, that's what I'm doin'", and there's your light opera, where they
sing in foreign and it basically goes "Beer! Beer! Beer! Beer! I like to
drink lots of beer!", although sometimes they drink champagne instead.
That's basically all of opera, reely.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Maskerade]]></description>

sort of things, like glass, only dark... dark glass things on our eyes...""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures]]></description>
