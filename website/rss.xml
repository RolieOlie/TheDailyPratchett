      <description><![CDATA["The Monks of Cool, whose tiny and exclusive monastery is hidden in a really
cool and laid-back valley in the lower Ramtops, have a passing-out test for a
novice. He is taken into a room full of all types of clothing and asked: Yo,
my son, which of these is the most stylish thing to wear? And the correct
answer is: Hey, whatever I select."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The old shaman said carefully, "You didn't just see two men go through
upside down on a broomstick, shouting and screaming at each other, did
you?" The boy looked at him levelly. "Certainly not," he said. The old man
heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness for that," he said. "Neither did I.""<br><br>Rincewind and Twoflower take up broomstick flying - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["No-one could sit in that chair. It was full of old T-shirts and books and
supper plates and junk. There was a deep sock layer and possibly the Lost

      <description><![CDATA["A heap of discarded garments by the bed suggested that Verence had mastered
the art of hanging up clothes as practised by half the population of the
world, and that he had equally had difficulty with the complex topological
manoeuvres necessary to turn the socks the right way out."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["It was here that the thaum, hitherto believed to be the smallest possible
particle of magic, was succesfully demonstrated to be made up of /resons/
(Lit.: 'Thing-ies') or reality fragments. Currently research indicates that
each reson is itself made up of a combination of at least five 'flavours',
known as 'up', 'down', 'sideways', 'sex appeal' and 'peppermint'."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>
