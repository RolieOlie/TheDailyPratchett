minutes. That's the way it goes. The moments that change your life are

      <description><![CDATA["Sam Vimes could parallel process. Most husbands can. They learn to follow
their own line of thought while at the same time listening to what their
wives say. And the listening is important, because at any time they could
be challenged and must be ready to quote the last sentence in full. A vital
additional skill is being able to scan the dialogue for telltale phrases
such as "and they can deliver it tomorrow" or "so I've invited them for
dinner?" or "they can do it in blue, really quite cheaply.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["He had a unique stride: it looked as though his body was being dragged
forward and his legs had to flail around underneath it, landing wherever
they could find room. It wasn't so much a walk as a collapse, indefinitely
postponed."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Maskerade]]></description>
