      <description><![CDATA["Jaime had never realised that trees made a sound when they grew, and no-one
else had realised it either, because the sound is made over hundreds of
years in waves of twenty-four hours from peak to peak. Speed it up, and
the sound a tree makes is *vrooom*."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["FLORIDA (or FLORIDIA): A place where may be found ALLIGATORS, LONG-NECKED
TURTLES and SPACE SHUTTLES. An interesting place which is warm and wet and
there are geese. BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO SANDWICHES may be found here
also. A lot more interesting than many other places. The shape when seen
from the air is like a bit stuck on a bigger bit."<br><br>From A Scientific Encyclopedia for the Enquiring Young Nome

      <description><![CDATA["In the second scroll of Wen the Eternally Surprised a story is written
concerning one day when the apprentice Clodpool, in a rebellious mood,
approached Wen and spake thusly:
"Master, what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic
system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently
nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic
gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?"
Wen considered this for some time, and at last said: "A fish!"
And Clodpool went away, satisfied."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time]]></description>
