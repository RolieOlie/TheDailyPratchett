      <description><![CDATA["That's why it's always worth having a few philosophers around the place.
One minute it's all Is Truth Beauty and Is Beauty Truth, and Does A Falling
Tree in the Forest Make A Sound if There's No one There to Hear It, and
then just when you think they're going to start dribbling one of 'em says,
Incidentally, putting a thirty-foot parabolic reflector on a high place to
shoot the rays of the sun at an enemy's ships would be a very interesting

      <description><![CDATA["Jesus won't cut you off before you're through
    With him you won't never get a crossed line,
    And when your bill comes it'll all be properly itemised
    He's the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life.
    
    The phone line to the saviour's always free of interference
    He's in at any hour, day or night
    And when you call J-E-S-U-S you always call toll-free
    He's the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>
