      <description><![CDATA["This is very similar to the suggestion put forward by the Quirmian
philosopher Ventre, who said, "Possibly the gods exist, and possibly they
do not. So why not believe in them in any case? If it's all true you'll go
to a lovely place when you die, and if it isn't then you've lost nothing,
right?" When he died he woke up in a circle of gods holding nasty-looking
sticks and one of them said, "We're going to show you what we think of Mr
Clever Dick in these parts...""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Hogfather]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["My experience in Amsterdam is that cyclists ride  where the hell they
like and aim in a state of rage at all pedestrians while ringing their
bell loudly, the concept of avoiding people being foreign to them.

My dream holiday would be a) a ticket to Amsterdam b) immunity from
prosecution and c) a baseball bat  :-)"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>
