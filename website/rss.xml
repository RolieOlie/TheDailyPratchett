      <description><![CDATA["Most people in Lancre, as the saying goes, went to bed with the chickens
and got up with the cows. [footnote: Er. That is to say, they went to bed
at the same time as the chickens went to bed, and got up at the same time
as the cows got up. Loosely worded sayings can really cause
misunderstandings.]"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Maskerade]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Sister Mary headed through the night-time hospital with the Adversary,
Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called
Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan and Lord of

He gurgled. She gave him a tickle."<br><br>The antichrist is born - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["It's a sad and terrible thing that high-born folk really have thought that
the servants would be totally fooled if spirits were put into decanters
that were cunningly labelled *backwards*. And also throughout history the
more politically conscious butler has taken it on trust, and with rather
more justification, that his employers will not notice if the whisky is
topped up with eniru."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Hogfather]]></description>
