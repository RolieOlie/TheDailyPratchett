      <description><![CDATA[""Is that *you*?" said a female voice. It wasn't exactly an unpleasant one,
but it had a sharp penetrating quality. It seemed to be saying that if you
*weren't* you, then it was *your* fault. Johnny recognized it instantly. It
was the voice of someone who dialled the wrong numbers and then complained
that the phone was answered by people she didn't want to speak to."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Johnny and the Bomb]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Women's clothes were not a subject that preoccupied Cutwell much -- in

included any clothes at all -- but the vision in front of him really did
take his breath away."<br><br>Princess Keli prepares for her coronation - Terry Pratchett, Mort]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Take it from me, whenever you see a bunch of buggers puttering
around talking about truth and beauty and the best way of attacking
Ethics, you can bet your sandals it's all because dozens of other
poor buggers are doing all the real work around the place."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Small Gods]]></description>
