      <description><![CDATA["Well, they asked me in February, and I said it was coming out in November.
When they asked in March, I said it was coming out in November. In April I
pointed out that November, in fact, was going to be when the next book came
out. In May, when asked on many occasions about when Maskerade was coming
out, I said November. In November, it will be published. The same November
all the way through, too."<br><br>So Terry, when is 'Maskerade' coming out, then? - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>
