      <description><![CDATA["It was funny how people were people everywhere you went, even if the people
concerned weren't the people the people who made up the phrase "people are
people everywhere" had traditionally thought of as people. And even if you
weren't virtuous, as you had been brought up to understand the term, you
did like to see virtue in other people, provided it didn?t cost you
anything."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>
