      <description><![CDATA["- "If you're going to suggest I try dropping twenty feet down a pitch dark
  tower in the hope of hitting a couple of greasy little steps which might
  not even still be there, you can forget it," said Rincewind sharply.
- "There is an alternative, then."
- "Out with it, man."
- "You could drop five hundred feet down a pitch black tower and hit stones
  which certainly are there," said Twoflower.
Dead silence from below him. Then Rincewind said, accusingly, "That
was sarcasm.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["- "Pull me up, then," he hinted.
- "I think that might be sort of difficult," grunted Twoflower. "I don't
  actually think I can do it, in fact."
- "What are you holding on to, then?"
- "You."
- "I mean besides me."
- "What do you mean, besides you?" said Twoflower."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

them into dust and ten years later someone drops a drop of blood in the
wrong place and *guess who's back*? They returned more times than raw

      <description><![CDATA["*No-one* liked the Joshua N'Clement block. There were two schools of
thought about what should be done with it. The people who lived there
thought everyone should be taken out en then the block should be blown up,
and the people who lived *near* the block just wanted it blown up."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Johnny and the Dead]]></description>
