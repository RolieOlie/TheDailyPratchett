the servants would be totally fooled if spirits were put into decanters
that were cunningly labelled *backwards*. And also throughout history the
more politically conscious butler has taken it on trust, and with rather
more justification, that his employers will not notice if the whisky is
topped up with eniru."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Hogfather]]></description>
