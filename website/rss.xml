      <description><![CDATA["There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are
those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say:
this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass
is half empty.

The world *belongs*, however, to those who can look at the glass and say:
What's up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse *me*? This is my glass? I
don't *think* so. My glass was full! *And* it was a bigger glass!"<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Truth]]></description>

teeth and began again."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>
