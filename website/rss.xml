      <description><![CDATA[""One minute I'm just another rabbit and happy about it, next minute
*whazaam*, I'm thinking. That's a major drawback if you're looking for
happiness as a rabbit, let me tell you. You want grass and sex, not
thoughts like 'What's it all about, when you get right down to it?'""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["It was funny how people were people everywhere you went, even if the people
concerned weren't the people the people who made up the phrase "people are
people everywhere" had traditionally thought of as people. And even if you
weren't virtuous, as you had been brought up to understand the term, you
did like to see virtue in other people, provided it didn?t cost you
anything."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>

moment tended to ask themselves questions like "What is my purpose in
life?" very quickly lacked both."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of
the dead, and so people only go to hell if that's where they believe, in
their deepest heart, that they deserve to go. Which they won't do if they
don't know about it. This explains why it is so important to shoot
missionaries on sight."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Eric]]></description>
