heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness for that," he said. "Neither did I.""<br><br>Rincewind and Twoflower take up broomstick flying - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["A heap of discarded garments by the bed suggested that Verence had mastered

known as 'up', 'down', 'sideways', 'sex appeal' and 'peppermint'."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies]]></description>
