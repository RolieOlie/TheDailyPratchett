      <description><![CDATA[""Jesus won't cut you off before you're through
    With him you won't never get a crossed line,
    And when your bill comes it'll all be properly itemised
    He's the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life.
    
    The phone line to the saviour's always free of interference
    He's in at any hour, day or night
    And when you call J-E-S-U-S you always call toll-free
    He's the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["One or two of the old barrows had been exposed over the years, their huge
stones attracting their own folklore. If you left your unshod horse at one
of them overnight and placed sixpence on the stone, in the morning the
sixpence would be gone and you'd never see your horse again, either..."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Carpe Jugulum]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["*No-one* liked the Joshua N'Clement block. There were two schools of
thought about what should be done with it. The people who lived there
thought everyone should be taken out en then the block should be blown up,
and the people who lived *near* the block just wanted it blown up."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Johnny and the Dead]]></description>
