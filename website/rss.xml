      <description><![CDATA["The point is that descriptive writing is very rarely entirely accurate and
during the reign of Olaf Quimby II as Patrician of Ankh some legislation
was passed in a determined attempt to put a stop to this sort of thing and
introduce some honesty into reporting. Thus, if a legend said of a notable
here that "all men spoke of his prowess" any bard who valued his life would
add hastily "except for a couple of people in his home village who thought
he was a liar, and quite a lot of other people who had never really heard
of him.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>
