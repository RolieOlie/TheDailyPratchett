      <description><![CDATA["The ducks in St James's Park are so used to being fed bread by secret
agents meeting clandestinely that they have developed their own Pavlovian
reaction. Put a St James's Park duck in a laboratory cage and show it a
picture of two men -- one usually wearing a coat with a fur collar, the
other something sombre with a scarf -- and it'll look up expectantly."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman, Good Omens]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Bad spelling can be lethal. For example, the greedy Seriph of Al-Yabi was
cursed by a badly-educated deity and for some days everything he touched
turned to Glod, which happened to be the name of a small dwarf from a
mountain community hundreds of miles away who found himself magically
dragged to the kingdom and relentlessly duplicated. Some two thousand Glods
later the spell wore off. These days, the people of Al-Yabi are renowned
for being remarkably short and bad-tempered."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad]]></description>

them into dust and ten years later someone drops a drop of blood in the
wrong place and *guess who's back*? They returned more times than raw
broccoli."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Feet of Clay]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[""My house is your house", his brow suddenly furrowed and he looked worried,
"although only in a metaphorical sense, you understand, because I would
not, much as I always admired your straightforward approach, and indeed
your forthright stance, actually *give* you my house, it being the only
house I have, and therefore the term is being extended in an, as it were,
gratuitous fashion --"
Owlglass was clearly having some trouble getting to the end of the sentence."<br><br>Carpet philosophers at work - Terry Pratchett, The Carpet People]]></description>
