      <description><![CDATA["You never ever volunteered. Not even if a sergant stood there and said, "We
need someone to drink alcohol, bottles of, and make love, passionate, to
women, for the use of." There was *always* a snag. If a choir of angels
asked for volunteers for Paradise to step forward, Nobby knew enough to
take one smart pace to the rear."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Feet of Clay]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["- "Pull me up, then," he hinted.
- "I think that might be sort of difficult," grunted Twoflower. "I don't
  actually think I can do it, in fact."
- "What are you holding on to, then?"
- "You."
- "I mean besides me."
- "What do you mean, besides you?" said Twoflower."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[""One minute I'm just another rabbit and happy about it, next minute
*whazaam*, I'm thinking. That's a major drawback if you're looking for
happiness as a rabbit, let me tell you. You want grass and sex, not
thoughts like 'What's it all about, when you get right down to it?'""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["It was funny how people were people everywhere you went, even if the people
concerned weren't the people the people who made up the phrase "people are
people everywhere" had traditionally thought of as people. And even if you
weren't virtuous, as you had been brought up to understand the term, you
did like to see virtue in other people, provided it didn?t cost you
anything."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant]]></description>
