      <description><![CDATA[""Is that *you*?" said a female voice. It wasn't exactly an unpleasant one,
but it had a sharp penetrating quality. It seemed to be saying that if you

was the voice of someone who dialled the wrong numbers and then complained
that the phone was answered by people she didn't want to speak to."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Johnny and the Bomb]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Women's clothes were not a subject that preoccupied Cutwell much -- in

included any clothes at all -- but the vision in front of him really did
take his breath away."<br><br>Princess Keli prepares for her coronation - Terry Pratchett, Mort]]></description>
