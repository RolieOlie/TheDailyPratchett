      <description><![CDATA["It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to
think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault.
If it was us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be.
I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. *No one* ever thinks
of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the
bad things."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Jingo]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The vermine is a small black and white relative of the lemming, found in

by the vermine itself; the selfish little bastard will do anything rather
than let go of it."<br><br>Discworld wildlife - Terry Pratchett, Sourcery]]></description>
