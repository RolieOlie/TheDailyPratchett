      <description><![CDATA["SCIENCE: A way of finding things out and then making them work. Science
explains what is happening around us the whole time. So does RELIGION, but
science is better because it comes up with more understandable excuses when
it is wrong. There is a lot more Science than you think."<br><br>From A Scientific Encyclopedia for the Enquiring Young Nome
           by Angalo de Haberdasheri - Terry Pratchett, Wings]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The point is that descriptive writing is very rarely entirely accurate and
during the reign of Olaf Quimby II as Patrician of Ankh some legislation
was passed in a determined attempt to put a stop to this sort of thing and
introduce some honesty into reporting. Thus, if a legend said of a notable
here that "all men spoke of his prowess" any bard who valued his life would
add hastily "except for a couple of people in his home village who thought
he was a liar, and quite a lot of other people who had never really heard
of him.""<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Well, they asked me in February, and I said it was coming out in November.
When they asked in March, I said it was coming out in November. In April I
pointed out that November, in fact, was going to be when the next book came
out. In May, when asked on many occasions about when Maskerade was coming
out, I said November. In November, it will be published. The same November
all the way through, too."<br><br>So Terry, when is 'Maskerade' coming out, then? - Terry Pratchett, alt.fan.pratchett]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Our garden was debated territory between five local cats, and we'd heard
that the best way to keep other cats out of the garden was to have one
yourself. A moment's rational thought here will spot the slight flaw in
this reasoning."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Unadulterated Cat]]></description>
