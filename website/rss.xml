happens about once every six months -- if only everything was as reliable

      <description><![CDATA["Nomes live ten times faster than humans. They're harder to see than a high-
speed mouse. That's one reason why most humans hardly ever see them. The
other is that humans are very good at not seeing things they know aren't
there. And, since sensible humans know that there are no such things as
people four inches high, a nome who doesn't want to be seen probably won't
be seen."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Wings]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The figures looked more or less human. And they were engaged in
religion. You could tell by the knives (it's not murder if you do it
for a god)."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Small Gods]]></description>
