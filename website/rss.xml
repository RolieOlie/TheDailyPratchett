      <description><![CDATA["Hodgesaargh was an original storyteller and quite good in a very specific
way. If he'd had to recount the saga of the Tsortean War, for example, it
would have been in terms of the birds observed, every cormorant noted,
every pelican listed, every battlefield raven taxonomically placed, no tern
unturned. Some men in armour would have been involved at some stage, but
only because the ravens were perching on them."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Carpe Jugulum]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["The figures the telescope was producing were all that was left of an
exploding star twenty million years ago. A billion small rubbery things on
two planets who had been getting on with life in a quiet sort of way had
been totally destroyed, but they were certainly helping Adrian get his
Ph.D. and, who knows, they might have thought it all worthwhile if anyone
had asked them."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Johnny and the Dead]]></description>
