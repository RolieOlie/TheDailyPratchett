<h2>About</h2>
<p>This site was created as a tribute to Sir Terry Pratchett. Its goal is incredibly simple: to display a different quote every day. If you like the idea of reminding yourself about the work of Sir Terry, remember to come by tomorrow or consider subscribing to the mailing list. There is also a <a href="./website/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.
<p> Feeling a sudden urge to read a lot of quotes at once? <a href="http://www.lspace.org/books/pqf/">"The Pratchett Quote File"</a> may come in handy. This is the collection that was used as a source of quotes for this page.</p><p> The background <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2014_Meteor.jpg">photo</a> was taken by Jacek Halicki and is distributed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International</a> license.

<!-- ‘Goodbye,’ Mort said, and was surprised to find a lump in 
   his throat.  ‘It’s such an unpleasant word, isn’t it?’

   QUITE SO.  Death grinned because, as has so often been 
   remarked, he didn’t have much option.  But possibly he 
   meant it, this time.

   I PREFER AU REVOIR, he said. -->
